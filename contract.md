Below is the contract I submitted for my Honors Project proposal.

# Guiding Idea

My family's business manufactures cable assemblies, and we use bins to hold orders as they are being assembled. I would like to find out how to make a centralized system to help keep track of which order is in which bin, and to keep track of the status of each order.

# Methods of Research

I will use object-oriented programming to program at least two microcontrollers and a central host. I will use agile methods of iterative development in the evaluation and selection of hardware, languages, and libraries. I expect I will go through multiple 3-week prototyping cycles before arriving at a final design, and I will meet with the professor at the end of each cycle. I will take notes on my progress.

# Outcomes/Product

I will have a minimum of two small devices with e-ink displays that will show an order number and some information about the order. The devices will be able to be charged in some way when they arenâ€™t in use (like through solar power or induction). The devices will communicate with a central host over BTLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) or LoRa (Long Range), and the host can update each device with new information. I will be able to push buttons on each device to update its order status. The host can also see a list of all the devices and their order information, including status. I will compile a final report based on my notes, and present my project to the class.

# Project Timeline

10 September - Order hardware from Adafruit

24 September - Have proof-of-concept code that talks to hardware; meet with instructor; order more hardware if needed

8 October - Finish code for first prototype and meet with instructor; order more hardware if needed

29 October - Finish code for second prototype and meet with instructor; order more hardware if needed

19 November - Finish code for third prototype and meet with instructor; order more hardware if needed

10 December - Finish final product and meet with instructor

13 December - Present project

14 December - Submit completion report

I will meet with my instructor at least once every 3 weeks to discuss my progress, plans, and results as my research project progresses.
